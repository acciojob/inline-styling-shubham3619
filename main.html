		<p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within the ovule.</p>

		<p>Rose is a flower so beautiful that it has invoked inspiration in several artists and poets. Children are familiar with the rose and other such flowers right from toddlerhood when they took strolls in the garden, to the time they started enjoying picture books, to learning the alphabet ‘R’ for rose. The flower may have been a part of their home décor, or a gift they gave someone on an occasion.</p>
